hello-world
===========
This repository will contain my student files, starting with Python for Informatics on Coursera. I'll include worked exercises with notes on problems, how they were solved and what I learned. The goal is to capture things I've learned and to chart my development as a programmer.

I'm currently enjoying learning Python, next step is to learn cryptography. My goal is to learn the comp-sci fundamentals, because I'm considering getting into security research.
